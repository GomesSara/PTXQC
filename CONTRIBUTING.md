### Contributing - Get Involved!

We welcome input from our user base!
PTX-QC has a very permissive **BSD-3 clause License** (see [DESCRIPTION](DESCRIPTION) file), so feel free to fork, patch and contribute!
There are many ways to get involved, _you do not need to be a developer_!
  - suggest a new metric (and why you think it's useful) by opening [a new ticket][issuetracker] here on GitHub.
  - suggest changes to existing metrics (improvements or bugfixes), see above.
  - suggest improvements to our documentation (e.g. [additional vignettes][Ref_Vign])
  - write code (in R) and submit a [Pull Request (PR)][PullRequest].

### Bug reporting / Feature requests

If you encounter a bug, e.g. error message, wrong figures, missing axis annotation or anything which looks
suspicious, please use the [GitHub issue tracker][issuetracker] and file a report.

You should include
  - **stage** you encounter the bug, e.g. during installation, report creation, or after report creation (i.e. a bug in the report itself).
  - **PDF/Html report** itself (if one was generated).
  - **version of PTXQC**, e.g. see the report_XXX.pdf/html (where XXX will be the version) or see the DESCRIPTION file of the PTXQC package or call `help(package="PTXQC")` within R
  - **error message** (very important!). Either copy it or provide a screen shot.

Please be as precise as possible when providing the bug report - just imagine what kind of information you would like to have in order
to track down the issue.
In certain situations, the whole txt-folder or a single MaxQuant/mzTab file might be helpful to solve the problem.


For more information, e.g. installation, please visit the main [README.md](https://github.com/cbielow/PTXQC) of PTX-QC.
