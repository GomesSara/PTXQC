Ideally, RTs of identical peptides should be equal (i.e. very small
residual RT delta) across Raw files after alignment.</p>
<p>MaxQuants RT correction is shown in blue – it should be well within
the alignment search window (20min by default) set during MaxQuant
configuration. The resulting residual RT delta after RT alignment
(compared to a reference Raw file), is shown as green/red dots. One dot
represents one peptide (incl. charge). Every dot (peptide) outside an
allowed residual delta RT (1min by default) is colored red. All others
are green. The ratio of ‘green’ vs. ‘green+red’ peptides is annotated
using ‘sc:’ (for ‘score’) in the plot subtitles. High values are better
(green peptides dominate).</p>
<p>If moving ‘red’ dots to the horizontal zero-line (to make them green)
requires large RT shifts, then increasing the alignment search window

worth introducing artifical fractions into MaxQuant, to avoid

<p>MBR Transfer: Last of two steps (1=align, 2=transfer) during
Match-between-runs. If MaxQuant only transfers peptide ID’s which are
not present in the target file, then each Raw file should not have any
duplicates of identical peptides (incl. charge). Sometimes, a single or
split 3D-peak gets annotated multiple times, that’s ok. However, the
same peptide should not be annotated twice (or more) at vastly different
points in RT.</p>
<p>This plot shows three columns: - left: the ‘genuine’ situation
(pretending that no MBR was computed) - middle: looking only at
transferred IDs - right: combined picture (a mixture of left+middle,
usually)</p>
<p>Each peptide falls into three categories (the colors): - single
(good, because it has either one genuine OR a transferred ID). -
in-group (also good, because all ID’s are very close in RT) - out-group
(bad, spread across the RT gradient – should not be possible; a false
ID)</p>
<p>Heatmap score [EVD: MBR ID-Transfer]: The fraction of non-out-group
peptides (i.e. good peptides) in the middle column. This score is
‘pessimistic’ because if few ID’s were transferred, but all of them are
bad, the score is bad, even though the majority of peptides is still ok
(because they are genuine). However, in this case MBR provides few (and
wrong) additional information, and should be disabled.</p>

</h3>
<div class="helpText">
<p>Missing peptide intensities per Raw file from evidence.txt. This
metric shows the fraction of missing peptides compared to all peptides
seen in the whole experiment. The more Raw files you have, the higher
this fraction is going to be (because there is always going to be some
exotic [low intensity?] peptide which gets [falsely] identified in only
a single Raw file). A second plot shows how many peptides (Y-axis) are
covered by at least X Raw files. A third plot shows the density of the
observed (line) and the missing (filled area) data. To reconstruct the
distribution of missing values, an imputation strategy is required, so
the argument is somewhat circular here. If all Raw files are (technical)
replicates, i.e. we can expect that missing peptides are indeed present
and have an intensity similar to the peptides we do see, then the median
is a good estimator. This method performs a global normalization across
Raw files (so their observed intensitiy distributions have the same
mean), before computing the imputed values. Afterwards, the
distributions are de-normalized again (shifting them back to their)
original locations – but this time with imputed peptides.</p>
<p>Peptides obtained via Match-between-run (MBR) are accounted for
(i.e. are considered as present = non-missing). Thus, make sure that MBR
is working as intended (see MBR metrics).</p>

files), since peptide FDR is accumulating!?</p>

separate peptide) per Raw file.</p>
<p>The sum of frequencies may exceed 100% per Raw file, since a peptide
can have multiple modifications. E.g. given three peptides in a single
Raw file <br> 1. <em>M(Oxidation (M))LVLDEADEM(Oxidation (M))LNK</em>

<p>An oversampled 3D-peak is defined as a peak whose peptide ion (same
sequence and same charge state) was identified by at least two distinct
MS<sup>2</sup> spectra in the same Raw file. For high complexity
samples, oversampling of individual 3D-peaks automatically leads to
undersampling or even omission of other 3D-peaks, reducing the number of
identified peptides. Oversampling occurs in low-complexity samples or
long LC gradients, as well as undersized dynamic exclusion windows for
data independent acquisitions.</p>

Peptides in the ‘genuine + transferred’ category were identified within
the Raw file by MS/MS, but at the same time also transferred to this Raw
file using MBR. This ID transfer can be correct (e.g. in case of
different charge states), or incorrect – see MBR-related metrics to tell
the difference. Ideally, the ‘genuine + transferred’ category should be
rather small, the other two should be large.</p>
<p>If MBR would be switched off, you can expect to see the number of
peptides corresponding to ‘genuine (exclusive)’ + ‘genuine +
transferred’. In general, if the MBR gain is low and the MBR scores are
bad (see the two MBR-related metrics), MBR should be switched off for
the Raw files which are affected (could be a few or all).</p>

<p>Peptide precursor intensity per Raw file from evidence.txt WITHOUT
match-between-runs evidence. Low peptide intensity usually goes hand in
hand with low MS/MS identifcation rates and unfavourable signal/noise
ratios, which makes signal detection harder. Also instrument acquisition
time increases for trapping instruments.</p>
<p>Failing to reach the intensity threshold is usually due to
unfavorable column conditions, inadequate column loading or ionization
issues. If the study is not a dilution series or pulsed SILAC
experiment, we would expect every condition to have about the same
median log-intensity (of 2<sup>%1.1f</sup>). The relative standard
deviation (RSD) gives an indication about reproducibility across files
and should be below 5%%.</p>

PTXQC’s defaults. Change the threshold using the YAML configuration
file.</p>

<div class="helpText">
<p>Under optimal digestion conditions (high enzyme grade etc.), only few
missed cleavages (MC) are expected. In general, increased MC counts also
increase the number of peptide signals, thus cluttering the available
space and potentially provoking overlapping peptide signals, biasing
peptide quantification. Thus, low MC counts should be favored.
Interestingly, it has been shown recently that incorporation of peptides
with missed cleavages does not negatively influence protein
quantification (see <a href="https://doi.org/10.1021/pr500294d" class="external-link">Chiva,
C., Ortega, M., and Sabido, E. Influence of the Digestion Technique,
Protease, and Missed Cleavage Peptides in Protein Quantitation. J.
Proteome Res. 2014, 13, 3979-86</a> ). However this is true only if all
samples show the same degree of digestion. High missed cleavage values
can indicate for example, either a) failed digestion, b) a high
(post-digestion) protein contamination, or c) a sample with high amounts
of unspecifically degraded peptides which are not digested by
trypsin.</p>
<p>If MC&gt;=1 is high (&gt;20%) you should increase the missed
cleavages settings in MaxQuant and compare the number of peptides.
Usually high MC correlates with bad identification rates, since many

<p>MS/MS identifications can be ‘bad’ for a couple of reasons. It could
be computational, i.e. ID rates are low because you specified the wrong
protein database or modifications (not our concern here). Another reason
is low/missing signals for fragment ions, e.g. due to bad
(quadrupole/optics) ion transmission (charging effects), too small
isolation windows, etc.</p>
<p>Hence, we plot the TIC and base peak intensity of all MS/MS scans
(incl. unidentified ones) per Raw file. Depending on the setup, these
intensities can vary, but telling apart good from bad samples should
never be a problem. If you only have bad samples, you need to know the
intensity a good sample would reach.</p>
<p>To automatically score this, we found that the TIC should be 10-100x
larger than the base peak, i.e. there should be many other ions which
are roughly as high (a good fragmentation ladder). If there are only a
few spurious peaks (bad MS/MS), the TIC is much lower. Thus, we score
the ratio BP * 10 &lt; TIC (this would be 100% score). If it’s only BP *
3 &gt; TIC, we say this MS/MS failed (0%). Anything between 3x and 10x
gets a score in between. The score for the Raw file is computed as the
median score across all its MS/MS scans.</p>

corresponds to the number of contaminant proteins. The position of the
box gives the intensity distribution of the contaminants. Contaminants
should be lower compared to label-free samples, since all contaminants
introduced after the labeling should not be identified by Andromeda
(since they lack the isobaric tag).</p>
<p>There is a similar ‘Raw file’ based metric/plot based on
evidence.txt.</p>
<p>Heatmap score: none (since data source proteinGroups.txt is not
related 1:1 to Raw files)</p>
